**README**

Please note that the comet-perl code is under construction but
IS in a working state.

See the TODO for a list of things that need to be completed.


* Notes *

perlbal.sh is for running perlbal with the right lib directories
see conf/perlbal.conf

httpd.pl is a simple http server used for testing, perlbal connects to this
the doc root needs to be pointed at the dojo sources
this hasn't been tested with dojo yet

eventserver.pl loads the components that combine into the cometd event server

The lab/ directory is the old design for the cometd component.  This code
may make its way back into cometd


* START COMET AND DO A SIMPLE TEST *
* NOTE: This is broken now *
* I'm focusing on dojo + cometd now, and this simple test is getting in the way *


./httpd.pl &
./perlbal.sh &
./eventserver.pl

Go to http://127.0.0.1:2021/cometd in IE and Firefox

You will see a connect event, and some ping events ( every 15s )

./tools/injectevent.pl "It works"

You'll see the message on channel /pub/foo
