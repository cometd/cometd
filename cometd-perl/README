**README**

Please note that the comet-perl code is under construction and
isn't in a complete working state yet.

See the TODO for a list of things that need to be completed.


Notes:


perlbal.sh is for running perlbal with the right lib directories
see conf/perlbal.conf

httpd.pl is a simple http server used for testing, perlbal connects to this
the doc root needs to be pointed at the dojo sources
this hasn't been tested with dojo yet

eventserver.pl loads the poe components that combine into the cometd event
server

the lab/ directory is the old design for the cometd component.  This code
may make its way back into cometd
