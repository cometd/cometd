**README**

Please note that the comet-perl code is under heavy development
and isn't in a totally working state.  I've been making huge changes lately.

See the TODO for a list of things that need to be completed. Please
note that it isn't a complete list.

* Notes *

perlbal.sh is for running perlbal with the right lib directories
see conf/perlbal.conf

eventserver.pl loads the components that combine into the cometd event server
it has a built in http server, it's document root is html/

The lab/ directory is for old stuff and developers.


There are some tests that can be run:

perl Makefile.PL
(satisfy deps)
make test


* THESE TESTS ARE BROKEN DUE TO HEAVY DEVELOPMENT *

./eventserver.pl
