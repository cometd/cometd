GOALS

ยง Have a *safe* API, so that users cannot:
   + publish to a meta channel
   + subscribe to a channel before handshake
   + subscribe to a meta channel (they can listen to them though)
   + forget to call endBatch()

ยง Make implementation simpler
   + Make handshake synchronous, so implementors don't have to worry about queueing other messages

2. Have an extensible API
