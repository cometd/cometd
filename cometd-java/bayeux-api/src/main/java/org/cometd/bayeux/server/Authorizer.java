/**
 * <p>{@link Authorizer}s authorize {@link Operation operations} on {@link ServerChannel channels}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Authorizers can be {@link ConfigurableServerChannel#addAuthorizer(Authorizer) added to} and
 * {@link ConfigurableServerChannel#removeAuthorizer(Authorizer)}  removed from} channels, even wildcard
 * channels.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@link Authorizer}s work together with the {@link SecurityPolicy} to determine if a
 * {@link Operation#CREATE channel creation}, a {@link Operation#SUBSCRIBE channel subscribe} or a
 * {@link Operation#PUBLISH publish operation} may succeed.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>For an operation on a channel, the authorizers on the wildcard channels that match the channel and the
 * authorizers on the channel itself (together known at the <em>authorizers set</em> for that channel) will be
 * consulted to check if the the operation is granted, denied or ignored.
 * <br />
 * The list of wildcard channels that match the channel is obtained from {@link ChannelId#getWilds()}.</p>
 *
 * <p>The following is the authorization algorithm:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>If there is a security policy, and the security policy denies the request, then the request is denied.</li>
 * <li>Otherwise, if the authorizers set is empty, the request is granted.</li>
 * <li>Otherwise, if no authorizer explicitly grants the operation, the request is denied.</li>
 * <li>Otherwise, if at least one authorizer explicitly grants the operation, and no authorizer explicitly denies the
 * operation, the request is granted.</li>
 * <li>Otherwise, if one authorizer explicitly denies the operation, remaining authorizers are not consulted, and the
 * request is denied.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>The order in which the authorizers are checked is not important.</p>
 *
 * <p>Typically, authorizers are setup during the configuration of a channel:</p>
 * <pre>
 * BayeuxServer bayeuxServer = ...;
 * bayeuxServer.createIfAbsent("/television/cnn", new ConfigurableServerChannel.Initializer()
 * {
 *     public void configureChannel(ConfigurableServerChannel channel)
 *     {
 *         // Grant subscribe to all
 *         channel.addAuthorizer(GrantAuthorizer.GRANT_SUBSCRIBE);
 *
 *         // Grant publishes only to CNN employees
 *         channel.addAuthorizer(new Authorizer()
 *         {
 *             public Result authorize(Operation operation, ChannelId channel,
 *                                     ServerSession session, ServerMessage message)
 *             {
 *                 if (operation == Operation.PUBLISH &&
 *                         session.getAttribute("isCNNEmployee") == Boolean.TRUE)
 *                     return Result.grant();
 *                 else
 *                     return Result.ignore();
 *             }
 *         });
 *     }
 * });
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>A typical usage of authorizers is as follows:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Create a wildcard authorizer that matches all channels and neither grants or
 * denies (e.g. use {@link org.cometd.server.authorizer.GrantAuthorizer#GRANT_NONE}).
 * <br />
 * This authorizer can be added to channel /** or to a more specific channel for your application such as
 * /game/**.
 * <br />
 * This ensures that authorizers set is not empty and that another authorizer must explicitly grant access.</li>
 * <li>For public channels, that all users can access, add authorizers that will simply grant
 * publish and/or subscribe permissions to the specific or wildcard channels.</li>
 * <li>For access controlled channels (e.g. only nominated players can publish to a game channel), then
 * specific implementation of authorizers need to be created that will check identities and possibly other
 * state before granting permission.
 * <br />
 * Typically there is no need for such authorizers to explicitly deny access, unless that attempted access
 * represents a specific error condition that needs to be passed to the client in the message associated
 * with a deny.</li>
 * <li>For cross cutting concerns, such as checking a users credit or implementing user bans, authorizers
 * can be created to explicitly deny access, without the need to modify all authorizers already in place
 * that may grant.</li>
 * </ul>
