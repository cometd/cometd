    Provides the interfaces and classes for asynchronous (non-blocking) network I/O processing.
</p>

<p>
    The server socket is managed by {@link com.webtide.wharf.io.ServerConnector} implementations. <br/>
    For each new connection from a client, the following structures are created:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        an {@link com.webtide.wharf.io.async.AsyncCoordinator}, which coordinates the activity
        between an {@link com.webtide.wharf.io.async.AsyncServerEndpoint} and an
        {@link com.webtide.wharf.io.async.AsyncInterpreter}
    </li>
    <li>
        an {@link com.webtide.wharf.io.async.AsyncEndpoint}, which manages the physical I/O
    </li>
    <li>
        an {@link com.webtide.wharf.io.async.AsyncInterpreter}, which deserializes bytes into
        protocol messages, calls application code, and serializes protocol messages to bytes
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The flow of communication between the I/O system, the coordinator, the endpoint and the interpreter
    is the following, where === is the I/O system thread, --- is the read thread and ~~~ is the write thread.
</p>
Single read follows this flow:
<pre>
    I/O System         AsyncCoordinator       AsyncServerEndpoint        AsyncInterpreter
        ===== readReady =====>
                                ----- readInto ---->
                                <---- readFrom -----
                                -------------------------------- readFrom ---->
</pre>
Multiple reads follow this flow:
<pre>
    I/O System         AsyncCoordinator       AsyncServerEndpoint        AsyncInterpreter
        ===== readReady =====>
                                ----- readInto ---->
                                <---- readFrom -----
                                -------------------------------- readFrom ----->
                                <------------------------------ needsRead -----
                                ----- needsRead --->
                                                      -----+
                                                           | updates I/O key
                                                      <----+
                                <-------------------
        <------ wakeup -------
        ===== readReady =====>
</pre>
Single write follows this flow:
<pre>
    I/O System         AsyncCoordinator       AsyncServerEndpoint        AsyncInterpreter
                                <------------------------------- writeFrom ---
                                ----- writeFrom --->
</pre>
Partial writes follow this flow:
<pre>
    I/O System         AsyncCoordinator       AsyncServerEndpoint        AsyncInterpreter
                                <------------------------------- writeFrom ---
                                ----- writeFrom --->
                                                      -----+
                                                           | cannot fully write
                                                      <----+
                                <--- needsWrite ----
                                ---- needsWrite --->
                                                      -----+
                                                           | updates I/O key
                                                      <----+
                                <-------------------

                                                      <----+
          ==== writeReady ===>
                                ~~~~~~~ write ~~~~~>
                                                      ~~~~~+
                                                           | notify thread in wait

<p>
    Buffers are allocated for each connection by the interpreter, for read and for write.
</p>
<p>
    The interpreter is the object that manages concurrency, normally in a way that only one thread at a time
    can read/write from/to the buffers.<br />
    In cases where, for example, the interpreter offers blocking read semantic to user code (like in servlets),
    one reading thread may be put in wait, another thread may do a further physical read to fill the buffer
    from where the first reading thread will further read after being notified.
</p>
<p>
    Writes are always blocking, and the endpoint takes care of putting the writing thread in wait in case it
    cannot physically write to the I/O system, then it register for write interest.<br />
    When the I/O system is ready to write, the writing thread is notified and can flush the buffer.
