This is the common elements of the java servlet implementation of cometd server.

Currently this just contains the proposed common api.
Eventually this will contain an implementation against the servetl-3.0 
specification.

For a working implementation for servlet 2.x see ../cometd-jetty

To compile, you need to use maven 2.x 

   mvn install
