/**
 * <p>{@link OortMasterService} extends {@link OortService} to allow applications
 * to perform actions on entities that always live in a "master" node.</p>
 * <p>Applications may have entities that are naturally owned by any node. For
 * example, in a chat application a chat room may be created by a user in
 * any node, and be owned by the node the user that created it is connected to.</p>
 * <p>There are cases, however, where entities cannot be owned by any node, but
 * instead must be owned by one node only, usually referred to as the "master"
 * node.</p>
 * <p>A typical example of such an entity is a unique (across the cluster) ID
 * generator that produces IDs in the form of {@code long} - the primitive Java
 * type - values, or a service that accesses a storage (such as a file system)
 * that is only available on a particular node, etc.</p>
 * <p>{@link OortMasterService} makes easier to write services that perform actions
 * on entities that must be owned by a single node only.
 * There is one instance of {@link OortMasterService} with the same name for each
 * node, but only one of them is the "master".
 * Then, applications may call {@link #getMasterOortURL()} to get the Oort URL
 * of the "master" node, and pass that Oort URL to
 * {@link #forward(String, Object, Object)} as described in {@link OortService}.</p>
 *
 * @param <R> the result type
 * @param <C> the opaque context type
