/**
 * <p>Timesync extension (server side).</p>
 * <p>With each handshake or connect, the extension sends timestamps within the ext
 * field like: {@code {ext:{timesync:{tc:12345567890,l:23,o:4567},...},...}} where:
 * <ul>
 * <li>tc is the client timestamp in ms since 1970 of when the message was sent.
 * <li>l is the network lag that the client has calculated.
 * <li>o is the clock offset that the client has calculated.
 * </ul>
 * <p>A CometD server that supports timesync, can respond with an ext field like:
 * {@code {ext:{timesync:{tc:12345567890,ts:1234567900,p:123,a:3},...},...}} where:
 * <ul>
 * <li>tc is the client timestamp of when the message was sent,
 * <li>ts is the server timestamp of when the message was received
 * <li>p is the poll duration in ms - ie the time the server took before sending
 * the response.
 * <li>a is the measured accuracy of the calculated offset and lag sent by the
 * client
 * </ul>
 * <p>The relationship between tc, ts, o and l on the server is given by
 * {@code ts=tc+o+l} (the time the server received the message is the
 * client time plus the offset plus the network lag). Thus the accuracy of the o
 * and l settings can be determined with {@code a=tc+o+l-ts}.</p>
 * <p>When the client has received the response, it can make a more accurate
 * estimate of the lag as {@code l2=(now-tc-p)/2} (assuming symmetric lag).
 * A new offset can then be calculated with the relationship on the client that
 * {@code ts=tc+o2+l2}, thus {@code o2=ts-tc-l2}.</p>
 * <p>Since the client also receives the a value calculated on the server, it
 * should be possible to analyse this and compensate for some asymmetry in the
 * lag. But the current client does not do this.</p>
