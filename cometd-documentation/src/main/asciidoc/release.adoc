[[_release]]
== Committer Release Instructions

These instructions are only for CometD committers that want to perform a CometD release.

[[_release_create]]
=== Creating the Release

----
$ git clone git://github.com/cometd/cometd.git release/cometd
...
$ cd release/cometd
$ mvn clean install
...
$ mvn release:prepare # Specify the tag to be just the version number
...
$ mvn release:perform -Darguments=-Dgpg.passphrase=...
...
$ git push origin master
----

When the Maven Release Plugin runs it activates the `release` profile, running
sections of the `pom.xml` files that perform additional actions, such as building
the distribution tarball.

As the last step, the Maven Release Plugin will run an interactive Linux shell
script that performs a number of automated steps such as uploading the distribution
tarball, creating and uploading the JavaDocs, copying files to dependent GitHub
repositories, publishing to NPM, etc.

Below the manual steps that needs to be done to finish the release process.

[[_release_repository]]
=== Managing the Repository

Login to http://oss.sonatype.org[Sonatype OSS].

Click on "Staging Repositories" and you should see the staged project just
uploaded by the `mvn release:perform` command issued above, with status "open".
Tick the checkbox correspondent to the open staged project, choose "Close" from
the toolbar, enter a description such as "CometD Release 1.0.0", then click on
the "Close" button.
This will make the staged project downloadable for testing, but not yet published to central.

Tick again the checkbox correspondent to the closed staged project, choose "Release"
from the toolbar, enter a description such as "CometD Release 1.0.0", then click
on the "Release" button.
This will publish the project to the Maven Central Repository.

[[_release_archetype]]
=== Upload the Archetype Catalog

Make sure the archetype catalog `$HOME/.m2/archetype-catalog.xml` refers to
the release just prepared, then upload it.

----
$ dd if=$HOME/.m2/archetype-catalog.xml | ssh <user>@cometd.org "sudo -u www-data dd of=/var/www/cometd.org/archetype-catalog.xml"
