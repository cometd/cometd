==== Configuring the Java Server

You can specify `BayeuxServer` parameters and server transport parameters
in `web.xml` as init parameters of the `org.cometd.server.CometDServlet`.
If the CometD servlet creates the `BayeuxServer` instance, the servlet
init parameters are passed to the `BayeuxServer` instance, which in turn
configures the server transports.

If you followed <<_primer,the primer>>, Maven has configured the `web.xml`
file for you; here are details its configuration, a sample `web.xml`:

====
[source,xml]

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<web-app xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd"
         version="3.0">

        <url-pattern>/cometd/*</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>

</web-app>
----
====

You must define and map the `org.cometd.server.CometDServlet` in `web.xml`
to enable the server to interpret the Bayeux protocol.
It is normally mapped to `+/cometd/*+`, but you can change the `url-pattern` mapping
if you prefer, or even have multiple mappings.

==== Configuring `BayeuxServer`

Here is the list of configuration init parameters that the `BayeuxServer` implementation accepts:

.`BayeuxServer` Configuration Parameters
[cols="^2,^3,<10"]
|===
| Parameter Name
| Default Value
| Parameter Description

| allowedTransports
| ""
| A comma-separated list of `ServerTransport` names allowed.
  If not specified, the default server transports are allowed.

| broadcastToPublisher
| true
| When a publisher is also subscribed to the channel it publishes a message to,
  this parameter controls whether `BayeuxServer` should broadcast the message
  to all subscribers (including the publisher), or only to the other subscribers.

| jsonContext
| `org.cometd.server.JettyJSONContextServer`
| The full qualified name of a class implementing `org.cometd.common.JSONContext.Server`.
  The class is loaded and instantiated using the default constructor.

| transports
| ""
| A comma-separated list of `ServerTransport` implementation class names
  (that take a `org.cometd.server.BayeuxServerImpl` as only constructor
  parameter) that define the server transports.

| validateMessageFields
| true
| Whether message fields such as `channel`, `id` and `subscription` should be
  validated to contain legal characters as defined in
  <<_bayeux_protocol_elements,the Bayeux specification>>.

| sweepPeriod
| 997
| The period, in milliseconds, of the sweeping activity performed by the server.

|===

===== Configuring Server Transports

CometD server transports are pluggable; the CometD implementation provides
commonly used transports such as HTTP or WebSocket, but you can write your own.
You can configure the server transports using parameters that may have a prefix
that specifies the transport the parameter refers to.

For example, the parameter `timeout` has no prefix, and hence it is valid for
all transports; the parameter `callback-polling.jsonp.timeout` overrides the
`timeout` parameter for the `callback-polling` transport only, while `ws.timeout`
overrides it for the `websocket` transport (see `org.cometd.bayeux.Transport`
http://docs.cometd.org/apidocs/org/cometd/bayeux/Transport.html[javadocs] for details).

Here is the list of configuration init parameters (to be specified in `web.xml`)
that different server transports accept:

.`ServerTransport` Common Configuration Parameters
[cols="^2,^3,<10"]
|===
| Parameter Name
| Default Value
| Parameter Description

| timeout
| 30000
| The time, in milliseconds, that a server waits for a message before replying to a
  `/meta/connect` with an empty reply.

| interval
| 0
| The time, in milliseconds, that the client must wait between the
  end of one `/meta/connect` request and the start of the next.

| maxInterval
| 10000
| The maximum period of time, in milliseconds, that the server waits for a new
  `/meta/connect` message from a client before that client is considered invalid
  and is removed.

| maxProcessing
| -1
| The maximum period of time, in milliseconds, that the server waits for the
  processing of a message before considering the session invalid and removing it.
  A negative value means to wait forever.

| maxLazyTimeout
| 5000
| The maximum period of time, in milliseconds, that the server waits before delivering
  or publishing lazy messages.

| metaConnectDeliverOnly
| false
| Whether the transport should deliver the messages only via `/meta/connect`
  (enables server-to-client strict message ordering â€“ but not reliability).
  Enabling this option allows for server-to-client strict message ordering at
  the cost of a slightly chattier protocol (because delivery via `/meta/connect`
  may require waking up pending replies).

| maxQueue
| -1
| The maximum size of the `ServerSession` queue. A value of -1 means no queue size limit.
  A positive value triggers the invocation of
  `org.cometd.bayeux.server.ServerSession.MaxQueueListener` when the max queue size is exceeded.

| maxMessageSize
| <impl>
| The maximum size, in bytes, of an incoming transport message (the HTTP body
  or the WebSocket message - both may contain multiple Bayeux messages).
  The default value depends on the transport implementation.
|===

.Long Polling & Callback Polling `ServerTransport` Configuration Parameters
[cols="^2,^3,<10"]
|===
| Parameter Name
| Default Value
| Parameter Description

| maxSessionsPerBrowser
| 1
| The max number of sessions (tabs/frames) allowed to long poll from the same browser
  using the HTTP/1.1 protocol; a negative value allows unlimited sessions (see also
  <<_java_server_multiple_sessions,this section>>).

| http2MaxSessionsPerBrowser
| -1
| The max number of sessions (tabs/frames) allows to long poll from the same browser
  using the HTTP/2 protocol; a negative value allows unlimited sessions (see also
  <<_java_server_multiple_sessions,this section>>).

| multiSessionInterval
| 2000
| The period of time, in milliseconds, that specifies the client normal polling
  period in case the server detects more sessions (tabs/frames) connected from
  the same browser than allowed by the `maxSessionsPerBrowser` parameter.
  A non-positive value means that additional sessions are disconnected.

| browserCookieName
| BAYEUX_BROWSER
| The name of the cookie used to identify multiple sessions (see also
  <<_java_server_multiple_sessions,this section>>).

| browserCookieDomain
|
| The domain of the cookie used to identify multiple sessions (see also
  <<_java_server_multiple_sessions,this section>>). By default there is no domain.

| browserCookiePath
| /
| The path of the cookie used to identify multiple sessions (see also
  <<_java_server_multiple_sessions,this section>>).

| browserCookieSecure
| false
| Whether to add the `Secure` attribute to the cookie used to identify multiple
  sessions (see also <<_java_server_multiple_sessions,this section>>).

| browserCookieHttpOnly
| true
| Whether to add the `HttpOnly` attribute to the cookie used to identify multiple
  sessions (see also <<_java_server_multiple_sessions,this section>>).
|===

.WebSocket `ServerTransport` Configuration Parameters
[cols="^2,^3,<10"]
|===
| Parameter Name
| Default Value
| Parameter Description

| ws.cometdURLMapping
|
| *Mandatory*. A comma separated list of `url-pattern` strings defined by the
  `servlet-mapping` of the CometD Servlet.

| ws.messagesPerFrame
| 1
| How many Bayeux messages should be sent per WebSocket frame.
  Setting this parameter too high may result in WebSocket frames that may be
  rejected by the recipient because they are too big.

| ws.bufferSize
| <impl>
| The size, in bytes, of the buffer used to read and write WebSocket frames.
  The default value depends on the implementation. For the Jetty WebSocket
  implementation, this value is 4096.

| ws.idleTimeout
| <impl>
| The idle timeout, in milliseconds, for the WebSocket connection.
  The default value depends on the implementation. For the Jetty WebSocket
  implementation this value is 300000.

| ws.requireHandshakePerConnection
| false
| Whether every new WebSocket connection requires a handshake, see
  <<_security,the security section>>.

| ws.enableExtension.<extension_name>
| true
| Whether the WebSocket extension with the given `extension_name` (for example
  `ws.enableExtension.permessage-deflate`) should be enabled if client and
  server could negotiate it.
  If either the client or the server does not support the extension, then the
  extension cannot be negotiated and this option has no effect.
  Otherwise, both client and server support the extension, which is negotiated
  only if this option evaluates to true (i.e. either this option is absent or
  explicitly set to `true`); if this option evaluates to `false`, the extension
  is not negotiated.

===== Configuring the `CrossOriginFilter`

Independently from the Servlet Container you are using, Jetty provides a standard, portable,
`org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CrossOriginFilter`.
This filter implements the http://www.w3.org/TR/access-control/[Cross-Origin Resource Sharing]
specification, and allows recent browsers that implement it to perform cross-domain JavaScript
requests (see also <<_javascript_transports,the JavaScript transports section>>).

Here is an example of `web.xml` configuration for the `CrossOriginFilter`:

====

[[_java_server_configuration_servlet_30]]
===== Configuring Servlet 3 Asynchronous Features

The CometD libraries are portable across Servlet Containers because they use
the standard Servlet 3 APIs.

To enable the Servlet 3 asynchronous features, you need to:

* Make sure that in `web.xml` the `version` attribute of the `web-app` element is 3.0 <1>.
* Add the `async-supported` element to filters that might execute before the `CometDServlet`
  _and_ to the `CometDServlet` itself <2>.

[NOTE]
====
Remember to always specify the `load-on-startup` element for the CometD Servlet.
====

For example:

====
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<web-app xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd"
         version="3.0"> <1>

    <servlet>
        <servlet-name>cometd</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>org.cometd.server.CometDServlet</servlet-class>
        <load-on-startup>1</load-on-startup>
        <async-supported>true</async-supported> <2>
    </servlet>
    <servlet-mapping>
        <servlet-name>cometd</servlet-name>
        <url-pattern>/cometd/*</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>

    <filter>
        <filter-name>cross-origin</filter-name>
        <filter-class>org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CrossOriginFilter</filter-class>
        <async-supported>true</async-supported> <2>
    </filter>
    <filter-mapping>
        <filter-name>cross-origin</filter-name>
        <url-pattern>/cometd/*</url-pattern>
    </filter-mapping>

</web-app>
----
====

The typical error that you get if you do not enable the Servlet 3 asynchronous
features is the following:

----
IllegalStateException: the servlet does not support async operations for this request
----

[NOTE]
====
While Jetty is configured by default with a non-blocking connector that allows
CometD to run out of the box, Tomcat 7 is not, by default, configured with a
non-blocking connector.
You must first enable the non-blocking connector in Tomcat 7 in order for CometD
to work properly.
Please refer to the http://tomcat.apache.org[Tomcat documentation] for how to
configure a non-blocking connector in Tomcat.

[[_java_server_configuration_channels]]
===== Configuring `ServerChannel`

Server channels are used to broadcast messages to multiple clients, and are a
central concept of CometD (see also <<_concepts,the concepts section>>).
Class `org.cometd.bayeux.server.ServerChannel` represents server channels;
instances of server channels can be obtained from a `BayeuxServer` instance.

With the default security policy, server channels may be created simply by
publishing to a channel: if the channel does not exist, it is created on-the-fly.
This may open up for creation of a large number of server channel, for example
when messages are published to channels created with a random name, such as
`/topic/atyd9834o329`, and for race conditions during channel creation (since
the same server channel may be created concurrently by two remote clients
publishing to that channel at the same time).

To avoid that these transient server channels grow indefinitely and occupy a
lot of memory, the CometD server aggressively sweeps server channels
removing all channels that are not in use by the application anymore.
The sweep period can be controlled by the `sweepPeriod` parameter, see
<<_java_server_configuration_bayeux>>.

Given the above, you need to solve two problems:

* how to atomically create and configure a server channel
* how to avoid that channels that the application knows they will be used at a
  later time are swept prematurely

The solution offered by the CometD API for the first problem is to provide a
method that atomically creates and initializes server channels:

====
[source,java]
----
BayeuxServer bayeuxServer = ...;
MarkedReference<ServerChannel> ref = bayeuxServer.createChannelIfAbsent("/my/channel", new ServerChannel.Initializer() {
    public void configureChannel(ConfigurableServerChannel channel) {
        // Here configure the channel
    }
});
----
====

Method `BayeuxServer.createChannelIfAbsent(String channelName, Initializer... initializers)`
atomically creates the channel, and returns a `MarkedReference` that contains
the `ServerChannel` reference and a boolean that indicates whether the channel
was created or if it existed already.
The `Initializer` callback is called only if the channel is created by the
invocation to `BayeuxServer.createChannelIfAbsent()`.

The solution to the second problem is to configure the channel as _persistent_,
so that the sweeper does not remove the channel:

====
[source,java]
----
BayeuxServer bayeuxServer = ...;
MarkedReference<ServerChannel> ref = bayeuxServer.createChannelIfAbsent("/my/channel", new ServerChannel.Initializer() {
    public void configureChannel(ConfigurableServerChannel channel) {
        channel.setPersistent(true);
    }
});
----
====

You can not only configure `ServerChannel` instances to be persistent, but to
be _lazy_ (see also <<_java_server_lazy_messages,this section>>), you can add
listeners, and you can add `Authorizer` (see also
<<_java_server_authorizers,the authorizers section>>).

Creating a server channel returns a `MarkedReference` that contains
the `ServerChannel` reference and a boolean that indicates whether the channel
was created or if it existed already:

====
[source,java]
----
BayeuxServer bayeuxServer = ...;
String channelName = "/my/channel";
MarkedReference<ServerChannel> ref = bayeuxServer.createChannelIfAbsent(channelName, new ServerChannel.Initializer() {
    public void configureChannel(ConfigurableServerChannel channel) {
        channel.setPersistent(true);
    }
});

// Was the channel created atomically by this thread ?
boolean created = ref.isMarked();

// Guaranteed to never be null: either it's the channel
// just created, or it has been created concurrently
// by some other thread.
ServerChannel channel = ref.getReference();
----
====

The code above creates the channel, configures it to be persistent and then
obtains a reference to it, that is guaranteed to be non-null.

A typical error in CometD applications is to create the channel without making
it persistent, and then trying to obtain a reference to it without checking if it's null:

====
[source,java]
----
BayeuxServer bayeuxServer = ...;
String channelName = "/my/channel";

// Wrong, channel not marked as persistent, but used later
bayeuxServer.createChannelIfAbsent(channelName);

// Other application code here

ServerChannel channel = bayeuxServer.getChannel(channelName);
channel.publish(...); // May throw NullPointerException
----
====

Between the `BayeuxServer.createChannelIfAbsent()` call and the
`BayeuxServer.getChannel()` call there is
application code that may take a while to complete (therefore allowing the
sweeper to sweep the just created server channel), so it is always safer to
mark the channel as persistent, and when it is not needed anymore mark the
server channel as non persistent (by calling `channel.setPersistent(false)`),
to allow the sweeper to sweep it.

The server channel sweeper will sweep channels that are non-persistent, have
no subscribers, have no listeners, have no authorizers and have no children
channels, and only after these conditions are met for three consecutive sweeper passes.
