== Concepts and Architecture

The CometD project implements various https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_%28programming%29[Comet techniques]
to provide a scalable web messaging system, one that can run over HTTP or over
other emerging web protocols such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket[WebSocket].

[[_concepts_definitions]]
=== Definitions

The _client_ is the entity that initiates a connection, and the _server_ is
the entity that accepts the connection.
The connection established is persistent – that is, it remains open until
either side decides to close it.

Typical clients are browsers (after all, this is a web environment), but might
also be other applications such as Java applications, browser plugin applications,
or scripts in any scripting language.

Depending on the Comet technique employed, a client might open more than one
physical connection to the server, but you can assume there exists only one
logical _conduit_ between one client and the server.

The CometD project uses the Bayeux protocol (see also xref:_bayeux[the Bayeux protocol section])
to exchange information between the client and the server.
The unit of information exchanged is a Bayeux _message_ formatted in https://json.org[JSON].
A message contains several _fields_, some of which are mandated by the Bayeux protocol,
and others may be added by applications.
A field is a key/value pair; saying that a message has a _foo_ field means
that the message has a field whose key is the string _foo_.

All messages the client and server exchange have a _channel_ field.
The channel field provides the characterization of messages in classes.
The channel is a central concept in CometD: publishers publish messages to channels,
and subscribers subscribe to channels to receive messages.
This is strongly reflected in the CometD APIs.

[[_concepts_channels]]
==== Channel Definitions

A channel is a string that looks like a URL path such as `/foo/bar`,
`/meta/connect` or `/service/chat`.

The Bayeux specification defines three types of channels: _meta channels_,
_service channels_ and _broadcast channels_.

A channel that starts with `/meta/` is a meta channel, a channel that starts with
`/service/` is a service channel, and all other channels are broadcast channels.

A message whose channel field is a meta channel is referred to as a meta message,
and similarly there are service messages and broadcast messages.

The application creates service channels and broadcast channels; an application
can create as many as it needs, and can do so at any time.

[[_concepts_channels_meta]]
===== Meta Channels

The CometD implementation creates meta channels; applications _cannot_ create new
meta channels.
Meta channels provide to applications information about the Bayeux protocol (see
xref:_concepts_bayeux_protocol[this section]); for example, whether handshakes have
been successful or not, or whether the connection with the server is broken or
has been re-established.

[[_concepts_channels_service]]
===== Service Channels

Applications create service channels, which are used in the case of request/response
style of communication between client and server (as opposed to the publish/subscribe
style of communication of broadcast channels, see below).

[[_concepts_channels_broadcast]]
===== Broadcast Channels

Applications also create broadcast channels, which have the semantic of a messaging
topic and are used in the case of the publish/subscribe style of communication,
where one sender wants to broadcast information to multiple recipients.

[[_concepts_channels_wild]]
===== Use of Wildcards in Channels

You can use wildcards to match multiple channels: channel `+/foo/*+` matches `/foo/bar`
but not `/foo/bar/baz`.
The latter is matched by `+/foo/**+`.
You can use wildcards for any type of channel: `+/meta/*+` matches all meta channels,
and `+/service/**+` matches `/service/bar` as well as `/service/bar/baz`.
Channel `+/**+` matches all channels.

You can specify the wildcards only as the last segment of the channel, so these are
invalid channels: `+/**/foo+` or `+/foo/*/bar+`.

[[_concepts_channels_parameters]]
===== Use of Parameters in Channels

You can use segment parameters in channels: `/foo/{id}`.
Channels with segment parameters are also called _template_ channels, because they
define a template that a real channel may match, with the result of binding
the template channel parameters to actual values.
Template channels are used in annotated services, see their usage in
xref:_java_server_services_annotated_server_side_listener[annotated listeners]
and xref:_java_server_services_annotated_server_side_subscription[annotated subscribers].
For example, when `/news/{category}` is bound to the channel `/news/sport`, then
the parameter `category` will be bound to the string `"sport"`.

Template channels bound only if their number of segment is the same as the channel
is it bounded to. For example, for `/news/{category}` then `/news` does not bind
(too few segments), `/news/sport/athletics` does not bind (too many segments),
`/other/channel` does not bind (non parameter segments are different), while
`/news/football` binds the parameter `category` to the string `"football"`.

A template channel cannot be also a wildcard channel, so these are invalid channels:
`+/foo/{id}/*+` or `+/foo/{var}/**+`.

[[_concepts_high_level]]
=== The High Level View

CometD implements a web messaging system, in particular a web messaging system based
on the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish/subscribe[publish/subscribe] paradigm.

In a publish/subscribe messaging system publishers send messages, which are characterized
in classes.
Subscribers express their interest in one or more classes of messages, and receive
only messages that match the interest they have subscribed to.
Senders, in general, have no idea which or how many recipients receive the messages
they publish.

CometD implements the _hub-spoke_ topology.
In the default configuration, this means that there is one central server (the hub)
and all clients connect to that server via conduit links (the spokes).

image::hub_spoke.png[]

In CometD, the server receives messages from publishers and, if the message's
channel is a broadcast channel, re-routes the messages to interested subscribers.
The CometD server treats meta messages and service messages in a special way; it
does not re-route them to any subscriber (by default it is forbidden to subscribe
to meta channels, and it is a no-operation to subscribe to service channels).

For example, imagine that `clientAB` subscribes to channels `/A` and `/B`, and
`clientB` subscribes to channel `/B`.
If a publisher publishes a message on channel `/A`, only `clientAB` receives it.
On the other hand, if a publisher publishes a message on channel `/B`, both
`clientAB` and `clientB` receive the message.
Furthermore, if a publisher publishes a message on channel `/C`, neither
`clientAB` nor `clientB` receives the message, which ends its journey on the server.
Re-routing broadcast messages is the default behavior of the server, and it
does not need any application code to perform the re-routing.

Looking from a high level then, you see messages flowing back and forth among
clients and server through the conduits.
A single broadcast message might arrive at the server and be re-routed to all
clients; you can imagine that when it arrives on the server, the message is
copied and that a copy is sent to each client (although, for efficiency reasons,
this is not exactly what happens). If the sender also subscribes to the channel
it published the message to, it receives a copy of the message back.

[[_concepts_low_level]]
=== The Lower Level View

The following sections take a deeper look at how the CometD implementation works.

It should be clear by now that CometD, at its heart, is a client/server system
that communicates via a protocol, the Bayeux protocol.

In the CometD implementation, the https://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HalfObjectPlusProtocol[half-object plus protocol]
pattern captures the client/server communication: when a half-object on the
client establishes a communication conduit with the server, its correspondent
half-object is created on the server, and the two can – logically – communicate.
CometD uses a variation of this pattern because there is the need to abstract the
transport that carries messages to and from the server.
The transport can be based on the HTTP protocol, but in recent CometD versions
also on the WebSocket protocol (and you can plug in more transports).

In broad terms, the _client_ is composed of the client half-object and the client
transport, while the _server_ is a more complex entity that groups server
half-objects and server transports.

[[_concepts_sessions]]
==== Sessions

Sessions are a central concept in CometD.
They are the representation of the half-objects involved in the protocol communication.

image::hopp.png[]

There are three types of sessions:

* _Client sessions_ – the client half-object on the remote client side.
  Client sessions are represented by the `org.cometd.CometD` object in JavaScript,
  and by the `ClientSession` class (but more frequently
  by its subclass `org.cometd.bayeux.client.BayeuxClient`) in Java.
  The client creates a client session to establish a Bayeux communication with the
  server, and this allows the client to publish and receive messages.
* _Server sessions_ – the server half-object on the server side.
  Server sessions are on the server, and are represented by the
  `org.cometd.bayeux.server.ServerSession` class; they are the counterpart of client
  sessions.
  When a client creates a client session, it is not initially associated with a
  correspondent server session.
  Only when a client session establishes the Bayeux communication with the server
  does the server create its correspondent server session, as well as the link
  between the two half-objects.
  Each server session has a message queue.
  Messages publish to a channel and must be delivered to remote client sessions that
  subscribe to the channel.
  They are first queued into the server session's message queue, and then delivered
  to the correspondent client session.
* _Local sessions_ – the client half-object on the server side, represented by class
  `org.cometd.bayeux.server.LocalSession`.
  Local sessions can be thought of as clients living in the server.
  They do not represent a remote client, but instead a server-side client.
  Local sessions can subscribe to channels and publish messages like a client session
  can, but they live on the server.
  The server only knows about server sessions, and the only way to create a server
  session is to create its correspondent client session first, and then make it
  establish the Bayeux communication with the server.
  For this reason, on the server side, there is the additional concept of local session.
  A local session is a client session that happens to live on the server, and hence
  is local to the server. +
  For example, imagine that a remote client publishes a message every time it changes its state.
  Other remote clients can just subscribe to the channel and receive those state update messages.
  But what if, upon receiving a remote client state update, you want to perform some
  activity on the server? Then you need the equivalent of a remote client, but living
  on the server, and that's what local sessions are. +
  Server-side services are associated with a local session.
  Upon creation of the server-side service, the local session handshakes and creates
  the correspondent server session half-object, so that the server can treat client
  sessions and local sessions in the same way (because it sees them both as server
  sessions). The server delivers messages sent to a channel to all server sessions
  that subscribe to that channel, no matter if they are remote client sessions or
  local sessions. +
  For further information on services, see also xref:_java_server_services[the services section].

[[_concepts_server]]
==== The Server

The _server_ is represented by an instance of `org.cometd.bayeux.server.BayeuxServer`.
The `BayeuxServer` object acts as a:

* Repository for server sessions, see also xref:_concepts_sessions[the concepts sessions section].
* Repository for _server transports_ – represented by the `org.cometd.bayeux.server.ServerTransport` class.
  A server transport is a server-side component that handles the details of the communication
  with the client.
  There are HTTP server transports as well as a WebSocket server transport, and you can plug
  in other types as well.
  Server transports abstract the communication details so that applications can work knowing
  only Bayeux messages, no matter how they arrive on the server.
* Repository for _server channels_ – represented by the `org.cometd.bayeux.server.ServerChannel` class.
  A server channel is the server-side representation of a channel; it can receive and publish Bayeux messages.
* Repository for _extensions_ – represented by the `org.cometd.bayeux.server.BayeuxServer.Extension` class.
  Extensions allow applications to interact with the Bayeux protocol by modifying
  or even deleting or replaying incoming and/or outgoing Bayeux messages. +
  For further information about extensions, see also xref:_extensions[the extensions section].
* Central authorization authority, via an instance of the _security policy_ –
  represented by the `org.cometd.bayeux.server.SecurityPolicy` class.
  CometD interrogates the security policy to authorize any sensible operation
  the server performs, such as handshakes, channel creation, channel subscription
  and channel publishing.
  Applications can provide their own security policy to implement their own authorization logic. +
  For further information about the security policy, see
  xref:_java_server_authorization[the authorization section].
* _Authorizers_ – represented by the `org.cometd.bayeux.server.Authorizer`
  class allow you to apply more fine-grained authorization policies. +
  For further information on authorizers, see also xref:_java_server_authorizers[the authorizers section].
* Message processor, by coordinating the work of server transports, extensions
  and security policy, and by implementing a message flow algorithm (see
  xref:_concepts_message_processing[the message processing section]) that
  allows applications to interact with messages and channels to implement
  their application logic.

[[_concepts_listeners]]
==== Listeners

Applications use _listeners_ to interact with sessions, channels and the server.
The Java and JavaScript APIs allow applications to register different kinds of
listeners that receive notifications of the correspondent events.
You can usefully think of extensions, security policies and authorizers as special
types of listeners.
The following sections treat them as such.

[[_concepts_listeners_client]]
===== Client Sessions and Listeners

Examples of client session listeners include the following:

* You can add extensions to a client session to interact with the incoming and
  outgoing messages that arrive and that the session sends, via
  `ClientSession.addExtension(ClientSession.Extension)`.
* A client session is a repository for channels; you can add message listeners
  to a channel to notify you when a message arrives on that particular channel,
  via `ClientSession.getChannel(String).addListener(ClientSessionChannel.MessageListener)`.

[[_concepts_listeners_server]]
===== Servers and Listeners

On the server, the model is similar but much richer.

* You can add extensions to a `BayeuxServer` instance for all messages that
  flow through the server via `BayeuxServer.addExtension(BayeuxServer.Extension)`.
* `BayeuxServer` allows you to add listeners that it notifies when channels
  are created or destroyed via `BayeuxServer.addListener(BayeuxServer.ChannelListener)`,
  and when server sessions are created or destroyed via
  `BayeuxServer.addListener(BayeuxServer.SessionListener)`.
* `ServerChannel` allows you to add authorizers via `ServerChannel.addAuthorizer(Authorizer)`,
  and listeners that get notified when a message arrives on the channel via
  `ServerChannel.addListener(ServerChannel.MessageListener)`, or when a client
  subscribes or unsubscribes to the channel via `ServerChannel.addListener(ServerChannel.SubscriptionListener)`.
* `ServerSession` allows you to add extensions for messages that flow through
  the server session via `ServerSession.addExtension(ServerSession.Extension)`.
* `ServerSession` allows you to add listeners that get notified when the session
  is removed (for example because the client disconnects, or because the client
  disappears and therefore the server expires the correspondent server session)
  via `ServerSession.addListener(ServerSession.RemoveListener)`.
* `ServerSession` allows you add listeners that can interact with the server
  session's message queue for example to detect when a message is added to the
  queue, via `ServerSession.addListener(ServerSession.QueueListener)`, or when
  the queue is exceed a maximum number of messages, via
  `ServerSession.addListener(ServerSession.MaxQueueListener)`, or when the queue
  is ready to be sent via `ServerSession.addListener(ServerSession.DeQueueListener)`.
* `ServerSession` allows you add listeners that get notified when a message is
  received by the server session (no matter on which channel) via
  `ServerSession.addListener(ServerSession.MessageListener)`.

[[_concepts_message_processing]]
==== Message Processing

This section describes message processing on both the client and the server.
Use the following image to understand the detailed components view that make
up the client and the server.

image::hopp2.png[]

When a client sends messages, it uses the client-side channel to publish them.
The client retrieves the client channel from the client session via
`ClientSession.getChannel(String)`.
Messages first pass through the extensions, which process messages one by one;
if one extension denies processing of a message, it is deleted and it is not
sent to the server.
At the end of extension processing, the messages pass to the client transport.

The client transport converts the messages to JSON (for the Java client, this
is done by a `JSONContext.Client` instance, see also xref:_java_json_api[the JSON section]),
establishes the conduit with the server transport and then sends the JSON string
over the conduit, as the payload of a transport-specific envelope (for example,
an HTTP request or a WebSocket message).

The envelope travels to the server, where the server transport receives it.
The server transport converts the messages from the JSON format back to message
objects (through a `JSONContext.Server` instance, see also xref:_java_json_api[the JSON section]),
then passes them to the `BayeuxServer` instance for processing.

The `BayeuxServer` processes each message in the following steps:

. It invokes `BayeuxServer` extensions (method `incoming()`); if one
  extension denies processing, a reply is sent to the client indicating that the
  message has been deleted, and no further processing is performed for the message.
. It invokes `ServerSession` extensions (method `incoming()`, only if
  a `ServerSession` for that client exists); if one extension denies processing,
  a reply is sent to the client indicating that the message has been deleted,
  and no further processing is performed for the message.
. It invokes authorization checks for both the security policy and the authorizers;
  if the authorization is denied, a reply is sent to the client indicating the
  failure, and no further processing is performed for the message.
. It invokes server channel listeners; the application adds server channel listeners
  on the server, and offers the last chance to modify the message before it is
  eventually sent to all subscribers (if it is a broadcast message). All subscribers
  see any modification a server channel listener makes to the message, just as
  if the publisher has sent the message already modified.
  After the server channel listeners processing, the message is _frozen_ and no
  further modifications should be made to the message.
  Applications should not worry about this freezing step, because the API clarifies
  whether the message is modifiable or not: the API has as a parameter a modifiable
  message interface or an unmodifiable one to represent the message object.
  This step is the last processing step for an incoming non-broadcast message, and
  it therefore ends its journey on the server.
. If the message is a broadcast message, the message passes through
  `BayeuxServer` extensions (method `outgoing()`), then for each server
  session that subscribed to the channel, the message passes through `ServerSession`
  extensions (method `outgoing()`).
. If the message is a broadcast message, for each server session that subscribed
  to the channel, the message passes through `ServerSession` listeners, that have
  last chance to discard the message for that session; then the server session queue
  listeners (`MaxQueueListener` and `QueueListener`) are invoked and finally the
  message is added to the server session queue for delivery.
. If the message is a lazy message (see also xref:_java_server_lazy_messages[the lazy messages section]),
  it is sent on first occasion, otherwise the message is delivered immediately.
  If the server session onto which the message is queued corresponds to a remote
  client session, it is assigned a thread to deliver the messages in its queue
  through the server transport.
  The server transport drains the server session message queue, converts the
  messages to JSON and sends them on the conduit as the payloads of transport-specific
  envelopes (for example, an HTTP response or a WebSocket message). Otherwise,
  the server session onto which the message is queued corresponds to a local session,
  and the messages in its queue are delivered directly to the local session.
. For both broadcast and non-broadcast messages, a reply message is created, passes
  through `BayeuxServer` extensions and `ServerSession` extensions (method `outgoing()`).
  It then passes to the server transport, which converts it to JSON
  through a `JSONContext.Server` instance (see also xref:_java_json_api[the JSON section]),
  and sends it on the conduit as the payload of a transport-specific envelope (for
  example, an HTTP response or a WebSocket message).
. The envelope travels back to the client, where the client transport receives it.
  The client transport converts the messages from the JSON format back to message
  objects, for the Java client via a `JSONContext.Client` instance (see also xref:_java_json_api[the JSON section]).
. Each message then passes through the `ClientSession` extensions (method `incoming()`),
  and channel listeners and subscribers are notified of the message.

The round trip from client to server back to client is now complete.

[[_concepts_threading]]
==== Threading

When Bayeux messages are received by the server, a thread is allocated
(by the Servlet Container, not by CometD) to process
the messages, and server-side CometD listeners are invoked in this thread.
The CometD implementation does not spawn new threads to call server-side
listeners; in this way the threading model is kept simple and very similar to
the Servlet threading model.
Because this is the thread that runs the CometD code, let's call it the
_CometD thread_.

The CometD implementation also relies on a scheduler to perform periodic or
delayed tasks.
The execution of these tasks may invoke server-side CometD listeners, notably
implementations of `BayeuxServer.SessionListener#sessionRemoved()` and
`ServerSession.RemoveListener#removed()`.

This simple threading model implies that if a server-side CometD listener takes a long
time to process the message and to return control to the implementation, then
the implementation cannot process the next messages that may arrive, most often
halting the whole server processing and causing client disconnections.

This is due to the fact that a Bayeux client uses a limited number of connections
to interact with the server.
If a message sent to one connection takes a long time to be processed on the
server, the client may send additional messages on that connection, but those
will not be processed until the previous message processing ends.

It is therefore very important that if the application knows that a message may
trigger a time consuming task (for example a database query), it does so in a
separate thread, with a timeout to avoid to wait too long.

Similarly, if the application must contact an external service to provide
an answer to the CometD implementation, it must arrange things in a way that
either the external service is invoked in a separate thread, or invoking the
external service is itself non-blocking and based on callbacks (or another
similar mechanism).
See the xref:_concepts_application_authentication[asynchronous authentication examples]
below.

Services (see also xref:_java_server_services[the java server services section]) are an
easy way to setup server-side listeners but share the same threading model with
normal server-side listeners: if they need to perform time consuming tasks, they
need to do so in a separate thread, for example:

====
[source,java]
----
@Service
public class MyService {
    @Inject
    private BayeuxServer bayeuxServer;
    @Session
    private LocalSession localSession;

    @Listener("/service/query")
    public void processQuery(final ServerSession remoteSession, final ServerMessage message) {
        new Thread(() -> {
            Map<String, Object> data = performTimeConsumingTask(message);

            // Send data to client once the time consuming task is finished
            remoteSession.deliver(localSession, message.getChannel(), responseData, Promise.noop());
        }).start();
    }
}
----
====

[[_concepts_application]]
==== Application Interaction

Now that you know that applications interact with CometD through listeners, and
how both the client and the server process messages, you need to know what an
application should do to interact with messages to perform its business logic.

[[_concepts_application_authentication]]
===== Server-side Authentication

For an application to interact with authentication, it must register a custom
instance of a `SecurityPolicy` and override method `SecurityPolicy.canHandshake(...)`.
The `SecurityPolicy` can customize the handshake reply (for example, to give
details about an authentication failure) by retrieving the handshake reply from
the handshake request:

====
[source,java]
----
public class MySecurityPolicy extends DefaultSecurityPolicy {
    public void canHandshake(BayeuxServer server, ServerSession session, ServerMessage message, Promise<Boolean> promise) {
        boolean authenticated = authenticate(session, message);

        if (!authenticated) {
            ServerMessage.Mutable reply = message.getAssociated();
            // Here you can customize the reply
        }

        promise.succeed(authenticated);
    }
}
----
====

If the authentication process takes a long time, it can be moved to a different
thread to avoid blocking the CometD thread, here using
`CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(...)`:

====
[source,java]
----
public class MySecurityPolicy extends DefaultSecurityPolicy {
    public void canHandshake(BayeuxServer server, ServerSession session, ServerMessage message, Promise<Boolean> promise) {
        CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> authenticate(session, message))
                .whenComplete(promise.complete());
    }
}
----
====

The authentication process may be non-blocking and therefore there is no
need for additional threads, here using Jetty's `HttpClient`:

====
[source,java]
----
public class MySecurityPolicy extends DefaultSecurityPolicy {
    private final HttpClient httpClient;

    public MySecurityPolicy(HttpClient httpClient) {
        this.httpClient = httpClient;
    }

    @Override
    public void canHandshake(BayeuxServer server, ServerSession session, ServerMessage message, Promise<Boolean> promise) {
        httpClient.newRequest("https://authHost")
                .param("user", message.get("user"))
                .send(result -> {
                    if (result.isSucceeded()) {
                        if (result.getResponse().getStatus() == 200) {
                            promise.succeed(true);
                        } else {
                            ServerMessage.Mutable reply = message.getAssociated();
                            // Here you can customize the handshake reply to
                            // specify why the authentication was unsuccessful.

                            promise.succeed(false);
                        }
                    } else {
                        promise.fail(result.getFailure());
                    }
                });
    }
}
----
====

[[_concepts_application_unicast_messages]]
===== Interacting with Meta and Service Messages

Meta messages and service messages end their journey on the server.
An application can only interact with these kinds of messages via server channel
listeners, and therefore must use such listeners to perform its business logic.

You can add server channel listeners in the following ways:

* Directly via the API at initialization time (see
  xref:_java_server_services_integration[the services integration section]).
* Indirectly by using inherited services (see
  xref:_java_server_services_inherited[the inherited services section]).
  You accomplish this by calling `AbstractService.addService(...)`
  or via annotated services (see
  xref:_java_server_services_annotated[the annotated services section]) using
  `@Listener` annotations.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Applications that need to perform time consuming tasks in server-side listeners
should do so in a separate thread to avoid blocking the processing of other
incoming messages (see also xref:_concepts_threading[the threading section]).
====

[[_concepts_application_broadcast_messages]]
===== Interacting with Broadcast Messages

Broadcast messages arrive to the server and are delivered to all `ServerSessions`
that subscribe to the message's channel.
Applications can interact with broadcast messages via server channel listeners
(in the same way as with non-broadcast messages, see above), or by using a
`LocalSession` that subscribes to the message's channel.
You can use this latter solution directly via the API at initialization time (see
xref:_java_server_services_integration[the services integration section]), or
indirectly via annotated services (see
xref:_java_server_services_inherited[the inherited services section]) using
`@Subscription` annotations.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Applications that need to perform time consuming tasks in server-side listeners
should do so in a separate thread to avoid blocking the processing of other
incoming messages (see also xref:_concepts_threading[the threading section]).
====

[[_concepts_application_peer_communication]]
===== Communicating with a Specific Remote Client

Applications that want to deliver messages to a specific client can do so by
looking up its correspondent server session and delivering the message using
`ServerSession.deliver(...)`.

For example, remote client `client1` wants to send a message to another remote
client `client2`. Both clients are already connected and therefore have already
performed the handshake with the server.
Their handshake contained additional information regarding their `userId`, so
that `client1` declared to be "Bob" and `client2` declared to be "Alice".
The application could have used a `SecurityPolicy` or a
`BayeuxServer.SessionListener` to perform a mapping between the `userId`
and the server session's id, like explained in
xref:_java_server_authentication[the authentication section].

Now Bob wants to send a private message only to Alice.

The `client1` can use a service channel for private messages (such as
`/service/private`), so that messages are not broadcast, and the application is
set up so that a server channel listener routes messages arriving to
`/service/private` to the other remote client.

====
[source,java]
----

[[_concepts_application_broadcast_communication]]
===== Server-side Message Broadcasting

Applications might need to broadcast messages on a particular channel in
response to an external event.
Since `BayeuxServer` is the repository for server channels, the external
event handler just needs a reference to `BayeuxServer` to broadcast messages:

====
[source,java]
----
public class ExternalEventBroadcaster {
    private final BayeuxServer bayeuxServer;

    public ExternalEventBroadcaster(BayeuxServer bayeuxServer) {
        this.bayeuxServer = bayeuxServer;

        // Create a local session that will act as the "sender"
        this.session = bayeuxServer.newLocalSession("external");
        this.session.handshake();
    }

    public void onExternalEvent(ExternalEvent event) {
        // Retrieve the channel to broadcast to, for example
        // based on the "type" property of the external event
        ServerChannel channel = this.bayeuxServer.getChannel("/events/" + event.getType());
        if (channel != null) {
            // Create the data to broadcast by converting the external event
            Map<String, Object> data = convertExternalEvent(event);

            // Broadcast the data
            channel.publish(this.session, data, Promise.noop());
        }
    }
}

[[_concepts_bayeux_protocol]]
==== Bayeux Protocol

A client communicates with the server by exchanging Bayeux messages.

The Bayeux protocol requires that the first message a new client sends be a
_handshake_ message (a message sent on `/meta/handshake` channel). On the
server, if the processing of the incoming handshake message is successful,
`BayeuxServer` creates the server-side half-object instance (`ServerSession`)
that represents the client that initiated the handshake.
When the processing of the handshake completes, the server sends back a
handshake reply to the client.

The client processes the handshake reply, and if it is successful, starts –
under the covers – a heartbeat mechanism with the server, by exchanging _connect_
messages (a message sent on a `/meta/connect` channel). The details of this
heartbeat mechanism depend on the client transport used, but can be seen as
the client sending a connect message and expecting a reply after some time
(when using HTTP transports, the heartbeat mechanism is also known as _long-polling_).
The heartbeat mechanism allows a client to detect if the server is gone (the
client does not receive the connect message reply from the server), and allows
the server to detect if the client is gone (the server does not receive the
connect message request from the client).

Connect messages continue to flow between client and server until either side
decides to disconnect by sending a _disconnect_ message (a message sent on the
`/meta/disconnect` channel).

While connected to the server, a client can subscribe to channels by sending a
_subscribe_ message (a message sent on a `/meta/subscribe` channel). Likewise,
a client can unsubscribe from a channel by sending an _unsubscribe_ message
(a message sent on a `/meta/unsubscribe` channel). A client can publish messages
containing application-specific data at any time while it is connected, and to
any broadcast channel (even if it is not subscribed to that channel).

[[_concepts_binary_data]]
==== Binary Data

The xref:_bayeux[Bayeux protocol] message format is the JSON format, because the
Bayeux protocol was designed when JavaScript did not have binary data types.

Recent versions of JavaScript have
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays[typed arrays]
that can be used to represent raw binary data such as files or images.
A typical example of a JavaScript typed array is `Uint8Array` that represents
an array of unsigned, 8-bit, integers.
In turn, typed arrays are based on the lower level `ArrayBuffer` and `DataView`
types.

The JavaScript Web APIs have been enriched to use `ArrayBuffer` or higher level
typed arrays such as `Uint8Array`. In this way, applications can now read the
content of a file via JavaScript APIs such as `FileReader.readAsArrayBuffer()`
or use `XMLHttpRequest` to send and receive data as `ArrayBuffer`.

Java, of course, always had binary types in the form of `byte[]` and `ByteBuffer`.

Since Bayeux messages can only carry data in textual representation,
the CometD libraries support upload and download of binary data by converting
the binary data represented by JavaScript's `ArrayBuffer` or Java's `byte[]`
into a textual format using the https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:32/Z85/[Z85]
encoding/decoding and by using a specific format for the `data` field of a message.

The encoding/decoding to/from the binary representation is performed by
CometD extensions on both the client and the server, see
xref:_extensions_binary[the binary extension section].

When transporting binary data, the format of the `data` field of a message is
a specific one, represented by the `org.cometd.bayeux.BinaryData` class in Java
and by an equivalent structure in JavaScript, that is an object with the following
fields:

* The `data` field, carrying the binary representation of the data.
* The `last` field, that tells whether the `data` field is the last chunk
  of binary data.
* An optional `meta` field, carrying related additional metadata such as a file
  name, an image name, the MIME type of the binary representation (for example,
  `image/png`), etc.

A complete binary message therefore looks like this, in JSON format, _after_
the Z85 encoding:

====
[source,json]
----
{
    "id": "123456",
    "channel": "/binary",
    "clientId": "Un1q31d3nt1f13r",
    "data": {
        "data": "HelloWorld", /* Z85 encoded binary data */
        "last": true,
        "meta": {
            "content-type": "image/png"
        }
    },
    "ext": {
        "binary": {
        }
    }
}
----
====

Applications do not need to worry about the specific message format above
because CometD offers APIs that simplify the creation of messages
with binary data, for example see xref:_javascript_publish_binary[how to publish
binary data from JavaScript], xref:_java_client_send_binary[how to publish
binary data from Java] and
xref:_java_server_services_annotated_server_side_binary[the binary services section].
The CometD implementation takes care of producing the right message
format under the covers.

JavaScript applications can use `ArrayBuffer`, `DataView` or any typed array
object as the binary representation.

Java applications (either client or server) must use the `org.cometd.bayeux.BinaryData`
object as the binary representation.
