===== Inherited Services

A CometD inherited service is a Java class that extends the CometD class
`org.cometd.server.AbstractService`, which specifies the Bayeux channels of
interest to the service, and adheres to the contract the `AbstractService`
class defines:

====
[source,java]
----
public class EchoService extends AbstractService { <1>
    public EchoService(BayeuxServer bayeuxServer) { <2>
        super(bayeuxServer, "echo"); <3>
        addService("/echo", "processEcho"); <4>
    }

    public void processEcho(ServerSession remote, ServerMessage message) { <5>
        remote.deliver(getServerSession(), "/echo", message.getData()); <6>
    }
}
----
====

This is a simple echo service that returns the message sent by the remote
client on channel `/echo` to the remote client itself. Notice the following:

<1> Extends from `org.cometd.server.AbstractService.`
<2> Creates a constructor that takes a `org.cometd.bayeux.server.BayeuxServer` object.
<3> Calls the superclass constructor, passing the BayeuxServer object and an
    arbitrary name of the service, in this case "echo".
<4> Subscribes to channel `/echo`, and specifies the name of a method that
    must be called when a message arrives to that channel, via `addService(...)`.
<5> Defines a method with the same name specified in (4), and with an appropriate
    signature (see below).
<6> Uses the `org.cometd.bayeux.server.ServerSession` API to echo the message
    back to that particular client.

The contract that the `BayeuxService` class requires for callback methods is
that the methods must have the following signature:

====
[source,java]
----
public void processEcho(ServerSession remote, ServerMessage message)
----
====

Notice that the channel name specified in the `addService()` method may be a
wildcard, for example:

====
[source,java]
----
public class BaseballTeamService extends AbstractService {
    public BaseballTeamService(BayeuxServer bayeux) {
        super(bayeux, "baseballTeam");
        addService("/baseball/team/*", "processBaseballTeam");
    }

    public void processBaseballTeam(ServerSession remote, ServerMessage message) {
        // Upon receiving a message on channel /baseball/team/*, forward to channel /events/baseball/team/*
        getBayeux().getChannel("/events" + message.getChannel()).publish(getServerSession(), message.getData());
    }
}
----
====

Notice also how the first example uses `ServerSession.deliver()` to send a
message to a particular remote client, while the second uses `ServerChannel.publish()`
to send a message to anyone who subscribes to channel `+/events/baseball/team/*+`.

Method `addService(...)` is used to map a server-side channel listener with a
method that is invoked every time a message arrives on the channel.
It is not uncommon that a single service has multiple mappings, and mappings
may be even added and removed dynamically:

====
[source,java]
----
public class GameService extends AbstractService {
    public GameService(BayeuxServer bayeux) {
        super(bayeux, "game");
        addService("/service/game/*", "processGameCommand");
        addService("/game/event", "processGameEvent");
    }

    public void processGameCommand(ServerSession remote, ServerMessage message) {
        GameCommand command = (GameCommand)message.getData();
        switch (command.getType()) {
            case GAME_START: {
                addService("/game/" + command.getGameId(), "processGame");
                break;
            }
            case GAME_END: {
                removeService("/game/" + command.getGameId());
                break;
            }
            ...
        }
    }

    public void processGameEvent(ServerSession remote, ServerMessage message) {
        ...
    }

    public void processGame(ServerSession remote, ServerMessage message) {
        ...
    }
}
----
====

Note how mappings can be removed using method `removeService()`.

Each time a service instance is created, an associated `LocalSession` (see also
<<_concepts_sessions,this section>>) is created within the service itself: the
service is a local client.
The `LocalSession` has an associated `ServerSession` and as such it is treated
by the server in the same way a remote client (that also creates a
`ServerSession` within the server) is.
The `LocalSession` and `ServerSession` are accessible via the `AbstractService`
methods `getLocalSession()` and `getServerSession()` respectively.

[NOTE]
====
If an exception is thrown by a service method, it is caught by the CometD
implementation and logged at `INFO` level on a logger category corresponding
to the class name of the service, and no further action is taken by CometD.

Once you have written your Bayeux services it is time to set them up in your
web application, see either <<_java_server_services_integration,the services integration section>>
or <<_java_server_services_integration_spring,the Spring Framework services integration section>>.
