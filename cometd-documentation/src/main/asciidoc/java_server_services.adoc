==== Using Services

A CometD _service_ is a Java class that allows a developer to specify the code to run when Bayeux channels receive Bayeux messages.
When a message arrives on a channel to which the service instance subscribes, CometD invokes a callback method to execute user-specific code.

CometD services can be of two kinds:

* xref:_java_server_services_inherited[inherited]
* xref:_java_server_services_annotated[annotated]

You can also integrate CometD services with the Spring Framework as explained in xref:_java_server_services_integration_spring[the Spring Framework integration section].

The following sections present details about Java Server Services.
